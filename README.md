# TVV Dashboard: Tyler's VVV Dashboard



This is a fork of the Varying Vagrant Vagrants Dashboard for the excellent [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).  It is also meant as a replacement to the more cumbersome [TVV](https://github.com/tpkemme/TVV).

Its purpose is to add an optional Dark Mode and a Search and Replace Database tool to the VVV Dashboard.

---

### Note: Recent Changes

You can now toggle the Dark Mode Theme using the button in the sidebar.

There is also a new link under 'VVV Tools' that will bring you to the Search and Replace Database tool that is configured to work for all of your VVV sites.  The username and password will be same as your VVV MySQL credentials (usually 'root' and 'root') and then you can specify the table name to work on a specific site.

### Customizations

There are some customizations that you can do to VVV Dashboard

1. change settings in the `VVV/www/default/dashboard-custom.php`
2. create a custom.css and add custom CSS. This file is ignored when updating and autoloaded if exists.

Want the host list full view all the time with no scolling/overflow

create a `VVV/www/default/dashboard/custom.css` file and add this

```
.sites {
	max-height: 100%;
    overflow-y: auto;
    overflow-x: auto;
}
```
